# Twenty Fifteen child theme with Customize settings

This is the **Twenty Fifteen child** theme with Customize settings I used during my presentation at [WP Meetup Milano 16/06/2015](http://www.meetup.com/it/WordPress-Meetup-Milano/events/222609615/).
It's a very simple child theme where I wrote some functions that add **settings for the Customize**: an author name and photo that are shown in sidebar.  

Here you can find [the slides of my presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OD-1zw-RH-yC9K0ddkv3oGSWnQcn3YLOy6z11R42S4I/edit?usp=sharing).


## How to use

1. you need to have Twenty Fifteen theme already installed (it comes with standard WP installation);
1. unzip this package, rename the folder as *twentyfifteen-meetup* (or as you like) and put it inside *wp-content/themes* folder
1. of course, activate it via Customize: click the *Site Title & Tagline*  section to view the new settings
